**1. Clarity & Organization:**  
   The notebook is easy to follow and flows well. Each section is labeled, and the visuals make the analysis clear.
   
   It might help to add short notes before each pipeline step so readers know what’s happening.

**2. Feature Selection & Justification:**  
   The chosen features (age, BMI, smoker) make sense and are clearly linked to medical costs. Mapping smoker to numeric was a good move.
   
   You could also try adding features like region or number of children to see if they improve the model.

**3. Model Performance & Comparisons:**  
   The notebook explains the models and shows metrics clearly. The comparison between linear and polynomial regression is easy to understand.  
   
   Adding a plot of predicted vs. actual charges would make it even easier to see how well the models work.

**4. Reflection Quality:**  
   The reflections are honest and helpful. Challenges like skewed charges and extreme values are explained.  
   
   You might add a few sentences on what the results mean in real life or suggest other models to try next.

**Overall Feedback:**
This notebook is clear, well-structured, and shows thoughtful analysis. Small tweaks like more explanations or extra features could make it even stronger.
